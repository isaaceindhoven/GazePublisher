```php
    $gaze = new Gaze(
        "http://localhost:3333",    // $hubUrl -> Url to the hub
        __DIR__ . "/private.key",   // $privateKey -> Path to your private.key file
        3,                          // $maxTries -> Max tries for a single emit
        false                       // $ignoreErrors -> If set to true it will not throw errors if emit fails
    );

    /**
